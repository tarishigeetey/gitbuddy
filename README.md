# GitBuddy

GitBuddy is an AI-powered coding assistant designed to enhance your GitHub development workflow. It integrates with your GitHub repository to provide intelligent code suggestions, explanations, and insights. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain, GitBuddy helps developers quickly understand, improve, and troubleshoot their code

## üöÄ Purpose

The purpose of GitBuddy is to simplify and streamline the development process by helping developers quickly find relevant issues in their GitHub repositories. It helps by:

- Providing contextually relevant issues based on user queries.
- Offering a better way to search for issues in large repositories.

## üìö Lessons Learned

Key learnings from building GitBuddy so far include:

- Using the GitHub API to fetch issues dynamically from a repository.
- Implementing a basic AI-powered search mechanism for repository data.
- Leveraging Leveraging Ollama and LangChain for integrating AI-driven retrieval-augmented capabilities.
- Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the search and response quality.(vector database)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech-Stack

- GitHub API: For fetching issues from a specific repository.
- Ollama: For generating AI-powered responses and insights.
- LangChain: To build the AI-powered assistant that processes and retrieves issues.

 ## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

- Expand Query Types: Add more tools to interact with pull requests, code, commits, and other repository elements.
Build a UI: Develop a user-friendly interface to make interacting with GitBuddy more intuitive.
Authentication: Implement user authentication to access private repositories.
